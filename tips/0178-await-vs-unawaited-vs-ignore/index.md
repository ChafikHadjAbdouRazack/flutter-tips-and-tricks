# Futures: await vs unawaited vs ignore

When you call a method that returns a `Future`, you have a decision to make:

- use `await` (most common)
- use `unawaited`
- use `ignore`

This decision affects how the code is executed when the `Future` throws, so make sure you understand each case well.

Here's an explanation. ðŸ‘‡

<!--
Future<void> someFuture() => Future.error(UnimplementedError());

// Wait until complete. Execution is suspended if an exception is thrown
await someFuture();

// Don't wait. Execution will continue if an exception is thrown
someFuture();

// Same as above, but silences the unawaited_futures lint
unawaited(someFuture());

// Completely ignores this future and its result
someFuture().ignore();
-->
