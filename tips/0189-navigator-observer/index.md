# Adding a Navigator Observer

Ever wanted to track page views or add navigation breadcrumbs to your error logs?

This can be done by implementing a `NavigatorObserver`. âœ…

Here's some sample code showing how to implement this. ðŸ‘‡

<!--

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:developer';

class LoggerNavigatorObserver extends NavigatorObserver {
  @override
  void didPush(Route<dynamic> route, Route<dynamic>? previousRoute) {
    _logNavigation(route.settings.name, 'push');
  }

  @override
  void didPop(Route<dynamic> route, Route<dynamic>? previousRoute) {
    _logNavigation(route.settings.name, 'pop');
  }

  @override
  void didReplace({Route<dynamic>? newRoute, Route<dynamic>? oldRoute}) {
    if (newRoute != null) {
      _logNavigation(newRoute.settings.name, 'replace');
    }
  }

  void _logNavigation(String? routeName, String action) {
    if (routeName != null) {
      log("Screen $action: $routeName", name: 'Navigation');
    }
  }
}

To use the navigator observer, simply add it to the `MaterialApp` widget.

As a result, navigation logs will show in the console.

MaterialApp(
  observers: [
    LoggerNavigatorObserver(),
  ]
)

A couple of extra tips:

- some packages already offer a navigator observer (e.g. `SentryNavigatorObserver`), so you may not need to implement your own
- whatever you do, DON'T track page views on the `build` method (this can be called many times when widgets rebuild, and is out of your control)
