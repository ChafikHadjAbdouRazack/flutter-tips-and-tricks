# How to use Future.wait() in Dart

Do you need to execute multiple futures **concurrently** in Dart, and get all the results at once?

For that, you can use `Future.wait()`.

This will wait for all the futures to complete and return the results as a list, or throw an error if any of them fails.

**Note**: `Future.wait` enables concurrency, meaning that multiple futures can be run at once.

But this is **not** true parallelism, as they all run on the same **isolate**.

To run heavy computations in parallel, you need multiple isolates.
