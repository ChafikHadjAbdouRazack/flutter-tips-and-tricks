API keys storage: Client or Server?

A few examples of API keys and where to store them:

Firebase API Key and App Id â†’ Client
â†’ only used to identify the Firebase project, not to secure the connection

Firebase Admin API Key â†’ Server
â†’ unrestricted access to your Firebase project, bypassing all security rules

Stripe Publishable Key â†’ Client
â†’ only used to create tokens for payment methods

Stripe Secret Key â†’ Server
â†’ can charge customers and manage sensitive payment information

A few others... can you guess where they go and why?
â†’ Google Maps API Key
â†’ Supabase Public API Key
â†’ Supabase Service Role Key
â†’ OpenAI API Key
