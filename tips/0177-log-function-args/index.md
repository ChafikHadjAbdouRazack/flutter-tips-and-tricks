# Useful arguments in the log function (from dart:developer)

Did you know?

The humble [`log`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-developer/log.html) function (from `dart:developer`) has many arguments that can be used to customize the appearance of your logs.

If you don't want to use a 3rd-party logger package, this is a pretty good way to go. üëç

<!--
// log function args (dart:developer)
import 'dart:developer';

// Rather than interpolating strings in the message, pass them as arguments
log('trackAppCreated', name: 'Event');

log('trackScreenView($routeName, $action)', name: 'Navigation');

try {
  await into(epics).insertOnConflictUpdate(epic);
} on SqliteException catch (e, st) {
  log(e.toString(), name: 'Database', error: e, stackTrace: st);
  rethrow;
}
