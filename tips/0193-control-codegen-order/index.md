# Control the Code Generation Order

Did you know?

If you're using multiple code generators that depend on each other, build_runner may fail.

To fix this, you can enforce an explicit code generation order in your `build.yaml` file. ðŸ‘‡

global_options:
  freezed:
    runs_before:
      - json_serializable
  json_serializable:
    runs_before:
      - retrofit_generator

As a result, the generators will run in this order:

1. freezed
2. json_serializable
3. retrofit_generator
