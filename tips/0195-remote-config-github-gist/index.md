# Remote Config via GitHub Gist

Did you know?

You can remotely control the behaviour of your app by fetching some JSON from a GitHub gist.

This is super useful when implementing:

âœ… Force update
ðŸš© Feature flags
ðŸ§ª A/B testing

No Firebase or custom backend needed! ðŸ™Œ

<!--
Store this JSON in a Gist and fetch it during app startup:

{
  "config" : {
    "required_version": "2.0.0"
  },
  "feature-flags": [
    {
      "id": "new-paywall",
      "percentage": 10,
    },
    {
      "id": "feature-discovery",
      "percentage": 25,
    },
  ]
}

Then, use the values to control the behaviour of your app:

âœ… Force update
âœ… Feature flags
âœ… A/B testing

No backend needed!
