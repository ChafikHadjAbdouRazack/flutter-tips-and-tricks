# Hide Generated Dart Files in GitHub PRs

Did you know?

If you use build_runner and your generated Dart files are added to Git, you can hide them by default in your PRs and diffs.

To do this, simply add them to a .gitattributes file at the root of the project. ðŸ‘‡

<!--
To keep your generated files from showing in your diffs, add a .gitattributes file with these contents:

*.config.dart linguist-generated=true
*.freezed.dart linguist-generated=true
*.g.dart linguist-generated=true
*.gen.dart linguist-generated=true
*.gr.dart linguist-generated=true

Then, when you open a PR, the generated files wonâ€™t be rendered by default.
