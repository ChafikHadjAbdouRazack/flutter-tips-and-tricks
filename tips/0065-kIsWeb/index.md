# How `kIsWeb` works in Flutter

Do you know how `kIsWeb` is implemented in Flutter?

Here it is:

```dart
const bool kIsWeb = identical(0, 0.0);
```

Explanation:

- on web, Dart's doubles and ints are backed by the same kind of object (JS doesn't support integers)
- on the Dart VM, doubles and ints are different
