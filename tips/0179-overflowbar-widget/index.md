# The OverflowBar widget

Did you know?

[OverflowBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/OverflowBar-class.html) makes it easy to layout your widgets in a row unless they overflow the available horizontal space, in which case they're arranged as a column.

Both the horizontal and vertical spacing are customizable, as well as the overflow alignment. üëá

<!--

OverflowBar(
  // * Gap between children in the horizontal layout
  spacing: 8,
  // * Gap between children in the vertical layout (overflow)
  overflowSpacing: 4,
  // * Horizontal alignment of the children in the vertical layout
  overflowAlignment: OverflowBarAlignment.end,
  children: <Widget>[
    FilledButton(child: const Text('Option 1'), onPressed: () {}),
    FilledButton(child: const Text('Option 2'), onPressed: () {}),
    FilledButton(child: const Text('Option 3'), onPressed: () {}),
  ],
)

Note that `OverflowBar` differs from the [`Wrap`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Wrap-class.html) widget:

- when `Wrap` overflows, it keeps adding items horizontally.
- when `OverflowBar` overflows, it makes the entire layout vertical.

Different widgets for different use cases. üëç
