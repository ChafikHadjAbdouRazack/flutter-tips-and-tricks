# Taking screenshots with the Flutter CLI

Did you know that you take screenshots with the Flutter CLI?

To do this, run `flutter screenshot` from the terminal. Then, choose a device, and the screenshot will be saved in the current directory.

Note: this works **only** on the iOS and Android emulators - other platforms and real devices are not supported.
