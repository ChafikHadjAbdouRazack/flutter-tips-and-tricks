# Apple Small Business Program

Did you know?

If you sell apps on the iOS App Store, Apple will take a big cut:
- paid apps & IAPs: 30%
- subscriptions: 30% in the first year, 15% after
 
But if you make less than $1M/year, you can apply to the Small Business Program and slash your fees to 15%!

That's a no-brainer ðŸ’°

* if you sell to the EU, you can choose different terms (but thatâ€™s a bit of a mess ðŸ˜…)
