# Golden Image Testing with Robot Testing

This may not look like much, but getting the image below to be generated by a Golden Image Test was a challenge!

I've managed to do all this by piecing out information from various StackOverflow and GitHub issues, without using any 3rd party packages. 💪

How does it work? 🧵

Believe it or not, all these steps need to be done programmatically:

- loading a custom font (Roboto)
- loading the material icons as a font
- precaching all image assets

That's because widget tests (which golden tests are based on) won't do any of this by default.
