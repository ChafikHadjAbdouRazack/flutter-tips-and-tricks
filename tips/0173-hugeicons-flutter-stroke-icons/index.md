### Note about app bundle size and Android compatibility

Note that the package defines all the fonts as a single [woff2 file](https://github.com/hugeicons/hugeicons-flutter/blob/main/lib/fonts/hgi-stroke-rounded.woff2). This has two implications:

- Your app bundle size will increase as the font file will be included
- As noted in [this issue from 2022](https://github.com/hugeicons/hugeicons-flutter/issues/1), `woff2` files are not supported on Android. As a result, you can't use this package on Android as the icons will render incorrectly.
