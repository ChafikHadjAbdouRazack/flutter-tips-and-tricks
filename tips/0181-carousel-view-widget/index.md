# The CarouselView Widget

Did you know?

Since Flutter 3.24, a new `CarouselView` widget is available.

Here's how to use it:
- Limit its height with a `ConstrainedBox`
- Set the children size with `itemExtent` and `shrinkExtent`
- Use any widgets as children

Easy peasy! ðŸš€

<!--
ConstrainedBox(
  constraints: const BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 180),
  child: CarouselView(
    itemExtent: 320,
    shrinkExtent: 200,
    children: List<Widget>.generate(5, (int index) {
      return Image.asset(assets[index % 5]);
    }),
  ),
)
