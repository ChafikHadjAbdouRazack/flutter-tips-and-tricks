# Async Stream Initialization with async*

Did you know?

If you want to return a stream that depends on some asynchronous code, you can use `async*` and `yield*`.

This can be handy when you have an object that needs to be initialized asynchronously before it can start emitting events.

<!--
import 'package:in_app_purchase/in_app_purchase.dart';

Stream<List<PurchaseDetails>> purchaseStream() async* {
  final inAppPurchase = InAppPurchase.instance;
  // first, initialize asynchronously
  await inAppPurchase.isAvailable();
  // then, start vending events
  yield* inAppPurchase.purchaseStream;
}

Note: in most cases, itâ€™s best to perform the initialization separately. But if you ever need to initialize a Stream asynchronously, you can use async* and yield*
