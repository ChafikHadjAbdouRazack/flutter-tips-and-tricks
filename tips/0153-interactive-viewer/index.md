# Zoom an image with InteractiveViewer

Did you know?

You can use an `InteractiveViewer` widget to enable pan and pinch to zoom on any image. âœ¨

This is super handy and very useful on small screens (mobile).

You can set the `clipBehavior` property to `Clip.none` to let the image overflow the `InteractiveViewer`'s bounds when zooming, but this doesn't work as intended.

As a workaround, wrap the `InteractiveWidget` with `SizedBox.expand`. ðŸ‘Œ
