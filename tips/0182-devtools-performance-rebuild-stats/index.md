# DevTools Performance Rebuild Stats

Did you know?

Since Flutter 3.24, a new "Rebuild Stats" feature is available on the DevTools performance page.

Once you open it, simply use the app and the stats will update in realtime.

If you spot a widget that rebuilds too often, click on its location to go to the code.
