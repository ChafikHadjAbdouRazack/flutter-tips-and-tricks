TextField with Selection Height Style

TextField(
  selectionHeightStyle: BoxHeightStyle.tight,
)

Provide tight bounding boxes that fit heights per run. This style may result in uneven bounding boxes that do not nicely connect with adjacent boxes.

---

TextField(
  selectionHeightStyle: BoxHeightStyle.strut,
)

Boxes based on the strut will have consistent heights throughout the entire paragraph.
