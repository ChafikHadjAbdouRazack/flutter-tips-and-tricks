# Dark and Tinted Icons on iOS 18

Did you know?

iOS 18 supports dark and tinted icons.

To enable this in your Flutter app:
- Add one icon variant with transparency
- Configure `flutter_launcher_icons` in your `pubspec.yaml`
- Run `dart run flutter_launcher_icons`

Then, run the app and join the dark side! ðŸŒš

Following all the app icon guidelines on iOS and Android can be tricky.

To make life easier, my new course includes a whole module about launcher icons and splash screens.
