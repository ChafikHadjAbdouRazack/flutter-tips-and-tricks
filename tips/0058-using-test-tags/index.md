# Using test tags in Flutter

Ever wanted to filter tests so you only run the ones you need to?

This can be easily done using test tags.

Super useful when you have dozens/hundreds of tests and you want to target specific ones from the command line. 👇

There are configuration options to tag:

- an entire test suite (with the `@Tags` annotation)
- a test group or an individual test (with the tags argument)

More info on the test package documentation: https://pub.dev/packages/test#tagging-tests
