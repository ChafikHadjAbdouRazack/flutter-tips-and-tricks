# Flutter Web App Initialization Logic with CSS Loader

Did you know?

Apps created with Flutter 3.22 use a new, faster web bootstrap process.

The easiest way to upgrade your existing apps is to delete the web folder and recreate it again with the Flutter CLI.

> Note: if you recreate the Flutter web project from scratch, remember to update your `index.html`, icons, and manifest files with whatever customizations you had before.

<!--

Run this to upgrade your Flutter web project:

rm -rf web/
flutter create . --platforms web

Then, your web app will use the updated Flutter bootstrap code
(Flutter 3.22):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <base href="$FLUTTER_BASE_HREF">
  ...
</head>
<body>
  <script src="flutter_bootstrap.js" async></script>
</body>
</html>

-->

The new bootstrap process is quite customizable.

You can even display a CSS progress indicator before the Flutter app is ready to take over.
