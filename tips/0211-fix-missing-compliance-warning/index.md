# Fix for Missing Compliance Warning in App Store Connect

Tired of seeing the "Missing Compliance" warning when uploading builds to App Store Connect?

If your app does **not** use Non-Exempt Encryption, set `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` to `NO` in your `Info.plist` file in Xcode.

Upload your next build, and the warning will disappear. üëç
