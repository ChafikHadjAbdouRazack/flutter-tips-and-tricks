# Null-aware spread operator (...?)

Did you know?

In addition to the regular spread operator, Dart also has a **null-aware** variant.

This is useful if you want to produce a list of items by concatenating a collection that may be null (such as when implementing pagination). ðŸ‘Œ

<!--
Future<List<T>> loadNextPage(I currentPage) async {
  final List<T> items = await loadPage(currentPage);
  final List<T>? previousItems = state.valueOrNull;
  // return the previous items (if any) plus the new ones
  return [...?previousItems, ...items];
}
-->
