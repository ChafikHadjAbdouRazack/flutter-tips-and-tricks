# Material Icons Theme (VSCode Extension)

Tired of the old, boring VSCode default theme?

Then, install the [Material Icons Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) and upgrade all your file icons! ðŸ¤©

File nesting is properly supported, too, and the icons will be correctly left-aligned! ðŸŽ‰
