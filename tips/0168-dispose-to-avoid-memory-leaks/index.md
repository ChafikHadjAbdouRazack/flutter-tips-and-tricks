# Disposing fields to avoid memory leaks

Did you know?

Forgetting to dispose controllers in your `State` class can lead to memory leaks.

DCM has a handy "dispose-fields" rule that warns you about it.

And with a bit of help from Copilot, you can even fix this automatically. üëç

<!--
// If you have DCM installed, the dispose-fields rule will warn you if you forget to dispose your controllers
late final _menuController = AnimationController(
  vsync: this,
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 150),
);

// You can easily fix this by hand or with some help from Copilot
@override
void dispose() {
  _menuController.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
-->

To get started with DCM, you can read the [Quick Start guide](https://dcm.dev/docs/quick-start/)

Once you've registered your license key and installed the VSCode extension or IntelliJ plugin, simply add this to your `analysis_options.yaml`, and you're good to go:

```yaml
dart_code_metrics:
  extends:
    - recommended
```
